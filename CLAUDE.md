# @cosyte/dicom — Project Guide for Claude

## Project

**`@cosyte/dicom`** — a developer-focused DICOM parser + utility library for Node.js/TypeScript, published under the Cosyte brand. Open-source (MIT). Sibling to `@cosyte/hl7` at `../hl7-parser`.

**North star:** A developer can read a real-world, vendor-quirky DICOM Part 10 file and pull useful metadata fields out in one line — without having read the DICOM standard.

**Scope boundary (v1):** Metadata-first. Pixel data is exposed as raw `Buffer` + encapsulated fragments but **not decoded**. DIMSE network services and DICOMweb are explicit non-goals — tracked as future companion packages (`@cosyte/dicom-pixel`, `@cosyte/dicom-net`, `@cosyte/dicomweb`).

## Status

- **Phase 2 of 8 complete** (274/275 tests passing).

## Tech Stack (locked)

- **Language:** TypeScript (strict, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`)
- **Target:** ES2022, dual ESM + CJS via `tsup`
- **Node:** 22+
- **Package manager:** pnpm
- **Testing:** Vitest
- **Linting:** ESLint + Prettier
- **Runtime deps:** **≤ 3**, each MIT/Apache-licensed and ADR-justified. Deliberate divergence from `@cosyte/hl7`'s zero-dep rule; DICOM byte-level + charset work earns the exception.
- **License:** MIT

## Engineering Guardrails

- No `any`. No unjustified `as` casts. Use `unknown` and narrow.
- JSDoc (with `@example`) on every public export — feeds IntelliSense.
- Immutable by default. Mutation only via explicit methods (`setElement`, `addElement`, `removeElement`, `addItem`, `removeItem`).
- No `console.*` in library code. Throw typed errors or return results.
- Short, testable functions over big parsing blobs.
- Postel's Law: parser is liberal (lenient default + warnings with stable codes and byte-offset positional context); serializer is conservative (always emits spec-clean DICOM Part 10 with correct File Meta group length, even-length values, proper padding).
- Fatal errors only for unrecoverable structural corruption (4 Tier-3 codes: `NOT_DICOM_PART_10`, `INVALID_FILE_META`, `UNSUPPORTED_TRANSFER_SYNTAX`, `EMPTY_INPUT`). Everything else is a warning.
- Buffer-first API for binary values. String decoding respects `(0008,0005)` Specific Character Set.
- Data dictionary is generated at build time from the official DICOM Part 6 source and committed; runtime has no network/filesystem dependency on it.
- Coverage target: ≥ 90% on `src/parser/`, `src/dataset/`, `src/dictionary/`, `src/helpers/`.

## Style Reference

This project mirrors `@cosyte/hl7`'s tooling, artifact discipline, and engineering bar. Two deliberate divergences:

1. **Runtime deps allowed (≤ 3)** — see Tech Stack above.
2. **v1 scope narrower than the full standard** — metadata-first, no pixel decode, no network.

## Standing disciplines (every change)

These three bind every change in this repo (mirrored from the cosyte meta-repo's
`documentation/conventions.md`):

1. **Documentation follows code.** A public-surface / stack / status change isn't done until its
   docs are: this package's own docs (`docs-content/` + JSDoc), and — in the meta-repo — its
   `documentation/repos/<repo>.md` and the `ecosystem-map.md` status table.
2. **Version + changelog every meaningful change.** Add a Changeset (`pnpm changeset`, `patch`
   during pre-alpha) and keep `CHANGELOG.md`'s `[Unreleased]` current. Stay on `0.0.x` until first alpha.
3. **Crew + knowledgebase feedback loop.** When a standard, decision, or public surface changes,
   flag whether a `crew` skill or `knowledgebase` doc needs creating/updating — never silently skip.

Build, lint, format, and TypeScript settings come from the shared `@cosyte/*` config packages
(`@cosyte/tsconfig` · `@cosyte/eslint-config` · `@cosyte/prettier-config`; see
`documentation/conventions.md` → "Canonical toolchain (enforced)"). Node ≥ 22.
