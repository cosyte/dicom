"@cosyte/dicom": patch
---

The README now opens with the Cosyte mark, which follows the reader's color scheme.

A `<picture>` block above the H1 offers a dark-ground tile behind a `prefers-color-scheme: dark` media query, and carries the light-ground tile as the inner `<img>`. On a renderer that honors the switch, the mark sits on a ground that matches the page it is read on.

**Why the per-package banner goes.** It baked the package name and the one-line tagline into pixels, and the two lines directly beneath it repeated both. The shared lockup reads "Cosyte" while the H1 reads `@cosyte/dicom`, so the two strings differ, the duplication goes away, and the heading stays. Nothing else in the README moved, including the H1 and the blockquote beneath it.

**The failure mode is safe.** A renderer that strips `<source>` renders the inner `<img>`, so the worst case is a light-ground mark on a dark page, never a missing or broken image. On the npm package page the `<img>` is hoisted out of its `<picture>` by the anchor wrapper, so the light cut renders there, which is the correct one: npmjs.com has no dark mode.

**This construct is verified rather than proposed.** `@cosyte/astm` has carried the identical block since `e1033a0` and `@cosyte/hl7` since `1aee04b`, and on GitHub in dark mode the rendered image resolves to the on-dark tile with `PICTURE` as its parent element. The block was copied out of `hl7`'s README rather than retyped, and the two URLs were then diffed byte for byte against that file, because a transcription error in one of them is a broken image on a public package page. Both URLs were rechecked here before push and returned `200 image/png`, at 10513 and 10455 bytes, rather than trusted from the `live` flag in the assets manifest, which is a declaration made on evidence from another repo.

The alt text describes the mark itself, a plus set in two overlapping rounded squares beside the Cosyte wordmark, rather than the package. It is what a screen reader on the package page reads out, and what a reader gets when the image fails to load, so it says what the image is instead of repeating the heading below it. It was written after opening both PNGs.

No runtime behaviour changed: the parser, the dictionary, the warning surface, and the de-identification path are not part of this change.
